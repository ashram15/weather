# weather
This is a small side project experimenting with html/css and javascript. It is a website that displays the weather at a user-specified location (by zipcode or city).
 
Run the project here: 
<a src = "weatherapppractice-716d3767e651.herokuapp.com/">Weather Website</a>

This is a small side project experimenting with frontend development(HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend basics (Flask basics with Python and Jinga(Flask's templating engine)), and deployment (using Heroku). It is a website that displays the weather at a user-specified location (by zipcode or city).


The website uses a third-party weather API and sends a HTTP request to the API server which then returns a dataset in JSON format. The program then parses this JSON data to display the weather in Fahrenheit, the current conditions, and a corresponding weather icon of user's location on the website.
