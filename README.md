# Weather Website

<strong>Run the project here:</strong> [live application](https://weatherapppractice-716d3767e651.herokuapp.com/)

This is a small side project experimenting with full stack development. A web application that provides <strong>real-time</strong> weather information for any user-specified location by city name or zip-code. 
The project was build to practice with frontend development, backend server setup, API integration, and deployment.

## Features
<strong>Weather Search</strong>: Users can input a city name or zip code to obtain their area's weather conditions in real-time. 
<strong>Dynamic Data Display</strong>: The web application also displays a small icon describing the weather conditions(e.g.,"Cloudy", "Sunny", "Overcast") in the user-specified locaiton.
<strong>API Integration</strong>: Uses JavaScript to send a HTTP request to a third party weather API and then parses the returned JSON response to obtain the weather data.
